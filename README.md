# Snake-w-OpenGL

This is a simple snake game written in C++.
For graphical library, OpenGL is used.

From Snake-w-OpenGL.cpp Line 27, you can change the player_count. For now, up to 2 players are allowed to play due to the lack of key assigment.
For player one use arrow keys to move, for player two use 8,4,5,6 from numpad to move.
